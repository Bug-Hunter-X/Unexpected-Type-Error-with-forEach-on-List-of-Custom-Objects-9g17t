# Dart forEach Type Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon type error that can occur when using the `forEach` method on a list of custom objects in Dart.  The error arises when attempting to pass a function that doesn't match the expected type signature.

The `bug.dart` file contains the problematic code.  `bugSolution.dart` shows how to correctly iterate and handle such scenarios.

The issue is described in detail within the JSON metadata.  This showcases a situation where a seemingly simple iteration leads to an unexpected type error, common when transitioning from other languages with less strict typing.
